> [!NOTE]
> This tool is a work in progress. Please notify us of any bugs via the issues page.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> x86 architecture is NOT supported!

A CLI tool to update items on the Steam Workshop independently from the game.
Most workshop features are supported, but more are on their way!

This tool is confirmed working on:

- Linux Mint 22.1 x86_64 (Kernel: 6.8.0-71-generic; Shell: bash 5.2.21)
- Windows 10 22H2
- Windows 11 24H2

Built with the [Steamworks SDK](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/sdk) v1.62.

## Usage

> [!NOTE]
> Steam needs to be open (even in the background) to use the tool!

1. Install and setup vcpkg (only follow the first two steps, skip creating the project directory) - [Install and use packages with CMake](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcpkg/get_started/get-started)
   An example of what someone might do is this:
   
   ```bash
       cd C:\ && git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git
       cd vcpkg && bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
   ```
   
   Proceeded by setting `VCPKG_ROOT` environment variable and appending the same vcpkg root directory to the `PATH` environment variable.

2. Open a terminal/CLI in the program's containing folder in the folder:
   
   #### Windows
   
    In the File Explorer address bar with the breadcrums of the folder you're in, you can click the empty area and type `cmd` to open the terminal inside this folder.
    Alternatively, open the Command Prompt application and set the cwd:
   
   ```bash
       cd path/to/folder
   ```
   
    For paths with spaces, make sure to enclose them with the double-quotes `"` symbol.
   
   #### Linux / MacOS
   
    Open the respective terminal app and cd to the folder like the above codeblock.

3. Use the application! If you need some help with this, see the [examples](#examples).

## Examples

Consider a workshop item `123456789` for Project Zomboid (appid 108600) that follows Project Zomboid's [mod structure](https://pzwiki.net/wiki/Mod_structure)).
Most of these examples have Linux paths. The content example has both Windows and Linux paths to refer to if you need help.

> [!NOTE]
> These examples assume the cachedir is default. If the cachedir is set to a different path, update the examples accordingly.

### Updating the content

To update the content of your mod while on Windows:

```bash
SteamUploader -a 108600 -w 123456789 -c %USERPROFILE%\Zomboid\Workshop\ExampleMod\Contents
```

And similarly for Linux:

```bash
./SteamUploader -a 108600 -w 123456789 -c ~/Zomboid/Workshop/ExampleMod/Contents
```

### Updating the preview image

To update the preview of your mod with a gif (or other image formats):

```bash
./SteamUploader -a 108600 -w 123456789 -p ~/Workshop/ExampleMod/preview.gif
```

### Updating the description

To update the description of your mod, you need to create a text file which holds the description in [BBCode](https://pzwiki.net/wiki/BBCode):

```bash
./SteamUploader -a 108600 -w 123456789 -d "~/Zomboid/Workshop/Path with space/description.txt"
```

### Updating the tags

To set the tags to "Audio" and "Build 42" (Project Zomboid's specific Workshop tags):

```bash
./SteamUploader -a 108600 -w 123456789 -T "Animals,Build 42"
```

### Updating multiple things at once

You can combine multiple arguments at once to update different things in a single command:

```bash
./SteamUploader -a 108600 -w 123456789 -c ~/Zomboid/Workshop/ExampleMod/Contents -p ~/Zomboid/Workshop/ExampleMod/preview.gif -T "Animals,Build 42"
```

## Building

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This section may need updating. Currently the Windows CMake process isn't confirmed working and was ditched for release mode as it took us actual weeks to try and make it work, so it was ditched in favour of using v0.4.0 release process for Windows.

> [!NOTE]
> Using MSVC toolchain is not fully supported, use it at your own risk! MinGW is recommended on Windows, using the `x64-mingw-static` vcpkg triplet.

The only external dependency that is required to be manually installed is curl.
Windows users should install [curl for Windows](https://curl.se/windows/).
Linux users need to add the corresponding libcurl package via the system's package manager.

Building in release mode:

```shell
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build
```

You will want to add onto the first cmake command `-DVCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET=x64-mingw-static` if you are on Windows and are using MinGW.

Generating release archives:

```shell
cd build
cpack -G ZIP -C Release
```
